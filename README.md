About
-----

SA-MP Kitchen Sink is a GitHub project providing a skeleton for creating new San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP) projects - whether it is a gamemode or just a single filterscript.



Getting started
---------------

To start off with a new project using SA-MP Kitchen Sink you only need to clone the git-repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Pyrax/samp-kitchen-sink.git projectFolder



Automatic builds with AppVeyor
------------------------------

As a solution for automatic builds which includes the compilation of your scripts I used AppVeyor as it is a hosted CI solution which uses Windows as OS and therefore makes it uncomplicated to use the PAWN compiler.
